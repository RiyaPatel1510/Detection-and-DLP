## Direct Message (LinkedIn/Email)
Subject: Quick win detections/DLP playbook — would value your feedback

Hi <Name>,
I published a small detection/DLP pack (Sigma+Splunk, M365 DLP). If you trial it, could you share a brief testimonial (even anonymous) on impact (FP/MTTR/coverage)? There’s a 1‑min template via repo Issues → Testimonial. Happy to mention your org or keep it generic.
Thanks! — Riya

## What a good testimonial includes
- Context: org type/size (anon OK)
- What you used (rule name/playbook section)
- Impact metrics (e.g., FP ↓ 30%, MTTR ↓ 25%, coverage ↑ N hosts)
- Short quote (1–2 sentences)
- Consent to publish

## Where to ask
- LinkedIn blue‑team contacts, OWASP/BSides peers, university SOCs, community Slack/Discords.
